# Knowledge & Learning Theory

* [Epistemology](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#epistemology) – a "cheatsheet including fallacies, effects, illusions and biases."
  * Glossary for learning
* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is what I use for learning academic material, which is a tool that makes learning process an incredibly efficient one. It works due to spaced repetition.

## Optimizing Learning

* **Prioritize sleep and exercise**
  * **Sleep**
    * Your brain consolidates memories during sleep\( in both NREM and REM stages\), so short changing yourself on sleep also shortchanges you on your learning efficiency. It’s important to sleep the amount your body needs, generally 7–9 hours.

  * **Exercise**
    * Another essential lifestyle component that seems basic but really helps when done consistently. 
    * Reduces stress which is important for memory retention. Though being too chill also hurts performance. However, most people are the opposite and being too stressed hurts performance as well. 
* **Spaced Repition**
  * Reason? See the lovely image below:

* Self test, self test, self test. Finding practice material is honestly the best way you can learn and study. You are required to apply the knowledge. One way to self test is through flashcards or forcing yourself to explain or draw out a diagram from memory. Recognition is **not** the same thing as recall! Once we target our studying for recall, we will actually be able to study efficiently.
* Reading over your notes is usually not that great at all. Same goes for highlighting. Unless you cover the content up and force yourself to recall and just use the notes as a check.
* Learn how to use mnemonics \(visual ones are even better\) & look for patterns
  * mnemonics are great because our brain works better when things are cross connected. Randomly associating things with other seemingly unrelated things helps you lock in information and integrate it into your neural network.
  * [This site is great for learning different techniques](https://artofmemory.com/)
    * Right now, however, I stick to trying to break down the word/concept/idea into sounds & finding an image that is memorable. The memory palace is good for things that just aren’t sticking, but is a bit time consuming and sort of overkill for some things.
    * A real example I used when studying for my psychology final: I am trying to learn that the **G**eneral **A**daptation **S**yndrome is a consistent pattern of responses / physiological coping to stress that consists of three stages: **a**larm,**r**esistance, and **e**xhaustion. I will now make the mnemonic **GAS**es **ARE**Stressful
    * Sometimes it’s easier to use part of the entire word instead of just the first letter. Or break down syllables and form images. let’s say you were trying to learn that puerta\(spanish\) means door. Puerta kind of sounds/looks like part. Just think of someone parting ways at a door. That’s pretty memorable!
