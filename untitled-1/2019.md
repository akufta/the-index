# 2019



## 2019

What an interesting year, marked by changes–both heartbreaking and beautiful. I learned a lot about myself, especially weaknesses that I want to tackle in 2020. 2019 taught me some valuable lessons on what really matters, which is different for everyone. Trying to find what you value obviously is a life long difficult adventure. I think I gained a bit more clarity on what I personally find important.

Thinking about hard stuff is necessary sometimes to gain closure and answers because analyzing what first blindsides you might end up with a positive takeaway.

### Stress

For some reason, I have fallen out of habit with meditation, but I think I will try to restart in 2020. I honestly felt like when I started treating meditation like a chore, it became less valuable and effective. Then I started getting stressed about keeping a streak, and that's not really the point of meditation.

I feel this year I was stressed in a different way. Academic stress was less, partly because I cared less. I still had enough motivation and stress to do fine in my classes, but it wasn't really the source of stress.

This year, I encountered several different stressors that sort of happened in a quick succession. My usual strategy of dealing with life event stress works, but I don't think it's the healthiest way. To be frank, trying to maintain energy and act like I felt normal and my usual kind of ratchet goofy self was tough, and a few times I definitely wasn't able to keep it up. Though it's embarrassing to write that, if anyone reads this anyways, the point in talking about this is that it's important to not attack yourself for feeling. Though your pain might not be the worst if you compare it to X disaster in the world or Y other person, your pain is still valid and trying to suppress it because of that reason is kind of unhealthy.

I am still trying to come up with a game plan to deal with unexpected events in a better way. I feel like I can act pretty normal around most people, but acting is draining and makes it all feel kinda worse at times. Meditation probably would help with this, but sometimes you just gotta feel the feelings without letting them overtake you.

My usual stress reliever running has been a no go for the last 2 months and that kinda stinks, but I've found other ways to cross train, though they aren't my favorite.

The current action plan is to research ways of increasing resilience so I don't get as down on myself for feeling things, but also finding ways to counteract focusing on the negative \(if that makes sense?\)

### Sleep 8+ hours a night.

2018 Recap

> Have been pretty good about doing this in 2018! I usually try to be efficient with my time and go to bed early. I also just crash when I am exhausted anyways. For a summer speech class, I learned about the dangers of sleep deprivation, so it's pretty high priority for me to sleep. I plan to clean up the outline and post it sometime this year.
>
> Currently reading [Why We Sleep](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-We-Sleep/Matthew-Walker/9781501144325) by [Matthew Walker, PhD](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com), an eye opener of why we need more sleep. Also made me feel less guilty when I took naps in Uni. I _love_ naps and recommend them to everyone.

Continuing that trend and I love sleeping. I do love movies, but I am not really hooked on that many popular shows so I get a lot of sleep.

I read some interesting criticism on the Why We Sleep book and some arguments for "hacking" your sleep with different sleep patterns. Some of the arguments sort of make sense, but for practical reasons and my sample size of 1 observations, I still feel way better on 8 uninterrupted hours \(sometimes with a quick nap 8 or so hours later\) than on less.

This article also is a great read: [Science of sleep - supermemo.guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep) and I consult it sometimes when I am reading about sleep for no reason besides the fact I get really curious and fall into rabbit holes.

### Exercise

Training for the marathon had ups and downs, but was an amazing experience overall. Though I haven't really gone for a run since October 13th, the race, my mile total for this year is 736 miles which is much higher than 2018, which was 44 because I started running again \(after a surgery\) in November.

Running has been a big part of my life and I have made many great memories on runs, both solo and with friends.

I think when I return in 2020, I will be gucci. I had a genetic/mechanical issue again, but I bought some stuff that might help prevent my bone from breaking again in the future.

I've had injuries before, but not like this one. At least now I know what to look out for. Sometimes you try to listen to your body and still miss the signals, unfortunately. Darn it.

Anyways, a great cross training option I actually like is rowing. You have to be careful, but it really does take the stress away. It's also great for strength training. Form really is important!

### Nutrition

I continue to enjoy researching nutrition. This year, I find that I can add more healthy yet cheap meals with frozen veggies/fruit. A win for sure.

Not entirely focused on just nutrition, but I learned more about coffee and brewing it with a french press. Cold brew also tastes great.

#### Learning

2019 I wrote some articles and continued to maintain the site and add new features:

> I had a lot of fun learning how to code websites and mess around with layouts and design. This site's structure is based off of my art resources website, which I have worked very hard on this year.
>
> That project has 50+ articles and has been acquired a nice social media following. It also taught me how to mess around with JS and forking other people's projects. I also wrote an anatomy ebook for that site, a fun project that has been mildly lucrative, thanks to the community that reads my art site. If you are interested, I can share the link with you.

I kinda want to try making a Gatsby site, but that will require a lot of time so I might wait.

Anki continues to be an amazing resource and now it basically is 95% of my studying. It's a super high yield way to study and I think once you take the time to slowly integrate it in your workflow, it pays dividends.

The way I make cards continues to evolve, and I love using it.

> 2018: I love to send myself down the rabbit hole and stress float in the overload of info the internet brings. I used to stress about this, but I think it's part of my nature that helps me with projects.

I sometimes still get kind of concerned that my rabbit hole tendency is bad, and it certainly is when I am trying to make a decision quickly, but oh well. Trying to work on that one.

### Reading

I haven't read a ton of books this year, and I plan to reintegrate the 20 pages a day thing into my routine by 2020. So far while I have been on break, I have been doing a pretty okay job with it, but definitely could be more consistent.

Book recs for this year include [The Winter Soldier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37946436-the-winter-soldier) by [Daniel Mason](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31095.Daniel_Mason), [Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27982183-being-mortal), [Lincoln in the Bardo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo) by [George Saunders](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8885.George_Saunders), [The Hate U Give](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075671-the-hate-u-give) by [Angie Thomas](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15049422.Angie_Thomas), [Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18377999-gulp).

### Art

I actually did complete a few digital paintings this year, and I had a lot of fun with it.

I also uploaded a bunch of sketches to [instagram](http://akufta.art), though I think when I post more to social, I feel like I start caring about likes and start becoming too externally motivated, which is bad. However, I do like to upload my art but I need to centralize it all haha. Maybe I will figure out a system some day, but for now, it's a kind of haphazard post on some random platform this random picture I took time to take/edit.

### A few lessons from 2019

Debated including this out there but honestly I hope at least one of these are helpful to somebody.

A lot of them are probably really obvious, but I want to create a reference for myself to look at.

Some of these are things I had to apply to 2019 while some of them I learned because of events of this year.

* Second chances are good, but that's not the same as allowing yourself to be stepped on a bunch of times. There's a fine balance and it's hard to find.
  * Establish some boundaries, while still maintaining kindness
* When something you think will last forever ends, it will hurt. Even if things didn't end on a high note, you can still treasure the memories. The last note might involve a hard lesson, but that's how life rolls sometimes.
* Sometimes you can feel lonely when surrounded by a lot of people, and then you worry if you truly belong or not. Self love and acceptance are as important as your relationships to others.
* Stop making everything a competition and comparing yourself to others, you get better when you focus on yourself.
* Live more in the moment because otherwise it will all be a blur
* Plan ahead, but try to be flexible because even things you think are going to for sure happen, might not \(or it might be the other way around, things you think would never happen do happen\)
* Don't be overly paranoid, try to be prepared but also ready to go with the flow.
* Aim for balance and adaptability
* You can't change what happens, but you _are_ responsible for your actions and responses.
* Life has a lot of beautiful things that are easy to miss
* Something can be learned from almost every situation
* Don't view the world from a purely positive or negative lens–most things tend to be complex and never 100% good or bad. \(Seeing the good in bad things is less depressing. Seeing the bad in the good things helps to make sure injustice/shady stuff doesn't just slip through awareness.\)
* Naps and laughing and ice cream = amazing
* Work to be loving, patient, kind, aware.
