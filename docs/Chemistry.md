## Chem Notes

## Atomic Orbitals

### Orbital – NumberLetter (ie, 1s, 2s, 3p)

number denotes *how clos*e energy lv is to nucleus (ie, 1 being the closest) while letter designates the *shape* of the orbital

​	s - sphere
​	p - twin lobes, point in a specific direction. Max 3 pointing mutually @ rt <s to each other, p~x~, p~y~ and p~z~
​	d , f, g and beyond, the shapes get crazier
