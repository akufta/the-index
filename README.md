# Introduction

Welcome! This is a knowledge base where I document things important to me. It's full of many resources that have helped me improve my life. I will regularly update this as often as I can, I hope this is helpful!

### Creative Work + Articles

I write [articles ](http://kalispera.xyz)and create [artwork](https://www.behance.net/allisonkufta) about things I am interested in and care about. There are more links on the side containing other places I've made stuff on.
