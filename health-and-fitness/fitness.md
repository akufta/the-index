The physiology of exercise is quite interesting! The human body is immensely complex. 

On the topic of **muscle building**, Julian Sharpiro has some interesting articles:

A lifestyle for me, running is one of my favorite ways to stay in shape, increase cardio and endurance, and have great memories with  friends–the running community really is amazing. 

Life goals: 

* beat 5K PR of 20:37
* sub 3:30 marathon

For speed, it seems an 80/20 training plan is the best. 

### Pacing

Run 80-90% easy!

### Marathon

Probably will build up to +50mpw

#### Plan Template

M - R → 3 to 8 recovery  
T -  10 - 15 tempo/marathon pace runs. // strides  
W   R → 10 to 15 easy. Long run on tired legs  
Th - AM 3 to 8 recovery; same PM  
F - AM Easy 3 to 8; PM Track/Speedwork // strides  
S - 3 to 8 recovery  
Sun - +5 min → 15 to 20 long run



## Strength Training

### Weights

**Essential: Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Pull Ups/Dips**

+ protein & creatine important for muscle recovery.

### Bodyweight exercises

Also work well, though I think that weighted exercises can be more efficient in some ways.

Templates:

#### Stretches

* 3 Plane Neck Movement
* Finger Flexion/Extension
* Maximally open the hand, then make a fist
* Wrist Circles
* Make a fist and "draw a circle" with your pointer finger knuckle
* Elbow Circles
* Large Arm Circles
* Circular Shrugs
* Torso Twists
* Keep the arms straight, palms facing upward
* Side Bends
* Forward/Back Bends
* Bend forward loosely, allowing the spine to round
* Arch backward at the top of the movement
* Pelvic Tilts
* Hula-hoop Hip Circles
* Leg Rotations
* High Knee Raises
* Kick Backs / Butt Kicks
* Ankle Circles
* Point the toes and "draw a circle" with the big toe

* Chest Dips - 3x8 --&gt; 3x12 \(only added these the last couple of weeks of the routine
