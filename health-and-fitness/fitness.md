# Fitness

The physiology of exercise is quite interesting! The human body is immensely complex. 

One of my favorite resources is Julian Shapiro's articles on the topic:

## Running

A lifestyle for me, running is one of my favorite ways to stay in shape, increase cardio and endurance, and have great memories with  friendsâ€“the running community really is amazing. 

Life goals: 

* beat 5K PR of 20:37
* sub 3:30 marathon

For speed, it seems an 80/20 training plan is the best. 

#### Pacing

#### Marathon

[http://fellrnr.com/wiki/A\_Comparison\_of\_Marathon\_Training\_Plans](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans) - a good cross analysis of the best marathon training plans.  There are definitely different opinions regarding training philosphies and I will update this section after I have looked more into it. 



## Strength Training

### Weights

**Essential: Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Pull Ups/Dips**

+ protein & creatine important for muscle recovery.

Bodyweight exercises also work well, though I think that weighted exercises can be more efficient.
