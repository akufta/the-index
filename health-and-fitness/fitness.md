# Fitness

The physiology of exercise is quite interesting! The human body is immensely complex. 

One of my favorite resources is Julian Shapiro's articles on the topic:

A lifestyle for me, running is one of my favorite ways to stay in shape, increase cardio and endurance, and have great memories with  friendsâ€“the running community really is amazing. 

Life goals: 

* beat 5K PR of 20:37
* sub 3:30 marathon

For speed, it seems an 80/20 training plan is the best. 

### Pacing

### Marathon

Probably will build up to +50mpw

## Strength Training

### Weights

**Essential: Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Pull Ups/Dips**

+ protein & creatine important for muscle recovery.

### Bodyweight exercises

Also work well, though I think that weighted exercises can be more efficient in some ways.
