# Health & Fitness

Notes to synthesize what I know about health and fitness and my approach to a hopefully fulfilling and healthy life.

My favorite sites right now are [examine.com](https://examine.com)– an absolutely wonderful resource–and reddit's fitness and running subreddits. I find their wiki section a great place to start for other resources.&#x20;

## Sleep

Recently, I’ve invested more time into sleep, as per the [2018 Year In Review.](https://kalispera.xyz/post/2018/)

Optimal goal is to sleep 8+ hours every night because it really is essential for learning, memory, and general health.

[Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, PhD](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-We-Sleep/Matthew-Walker/9781501144325) is a really excellent book on the topic.
