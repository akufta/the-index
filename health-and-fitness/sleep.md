# Sleep



* Sleep serves a purpose fundamental to your heath.
  1. Your brain is actually more active in some regions when you are asleep.
  2.  Russel Foster, a neuroscientist, \(2013\) notes that there are three hypotheses on the purpose of sleep.
     1. Restoration– certain genes associated with metabolic activity and recovery are turned on only when asleep.
        1. Xie et.al \(2013\) found that in mice, cells in the brain actually shrink during sleep/anesthesia to allow cerebrospinal fluid to flow faster.
     2. Energy conversation–less supported, as you only save 110 calories.
     3. Brain processing and memory consolidation– supported by sleep studies. Ability to problem solve while fully slept is a 3x advantage.

**Sleep is Complex**

* Sleeping is much more than lying down, closing your eyes, and being inactive for hours at a time.
  1. Here is a visual of the progression of sleep stages and delta power density, which helps measure sleep intensity by Mirjam Ekstedt \(2005\).
  2. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \(2018\): Healthy sleep typically involves repeating cycles of around 90-110 minutes that are further divided into these 4 major stages, the first three are non-REM and the 4th is REM:
     1. Stages 1-3 is when your cardiovascular system, eye movements, and brain waves slow down.
     2. Your body temperature also drops.
        1. According to the Harvard School of Medicine \(2007\), the central body temperature is reduced by 1 to 2º F, which is actually physiologically significant.
           1. A low grade fever is really just 1 to 2º higher.
     3. Stage 4 is REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, which happens around “90 minutes” after falling asleep. Brain waves, heart rate, and blood pressure approach wakefulness levels and your breathing quickens. Most dreams occur during REM sleep, though you can dream in the other stages.
        1. Each night, you dream about 2 hours on average, even if you forget them.
           1. Some scientists believe dreaming may help process emotions.
        2. As you age, REM sleep time becomes less.
     4. All of these complex stages are coordinated by neurotransmitters.
  3. The total amount of sleep you need on average is variable.
     1. Age determines how much sleep you need.
        1. According to Eric J. Olson, M.D \(2016\), newborns need 14-17 hours a day, 6-13 year olds need 9 to 11 hours, and adults 18 and over need 7 to 9 hours.
     2. Genes also play a large role. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \(2018\) states that many genes are involved with sleep and sleep disorders. Specifically, “\[s\]ome ‘clock’ genes such as _Per_, _tim_, and _Cry_” influence our circadian rhythm and timing. Other are linked to sleep disorders like narcolepsy and restless legs syndrome.

**Issues of Sleep Deprivation**

* Even though some aspects of sleep are mysterious, there are substantial studies of what happens without sleep.
  1. A chronic lack of sleep effects every single organ system.
     1. Scientists conduct longitudinal studies to analyze the effect sleep deprivation has on long term health.
     2. Causes include long work hours, often 24/7 access to digital entertainment, or medical problems.
     3. Patrick Finan, Ph.D \(2016\) of John’s Hopkins Medicine reports a few startling statistics, and here are just a few:
        1. “6,000 fatal car crashes” are caused by drowsy driving each year.
        2. “33% increase in dementia risk”
        3. “x3 risk for Type 2 diabetes”
        4. Decreased immune function
        5. “50% higher risk for obesity if you sleep less than 5 hours” on average due to increased release of hunger hormone gherlin and decreased release of satiety hormone leptin.
        6. Greater risk for mood disorders like anxiety and depression.
  2. Even acute sleep deprivation can be dangerous.
     1. According to a study conducted by Jolanta Orzel-Gryglewska \(2010\):
        1. At 24 hours, behavior is not altered, but fine motor control declines and physiological changes are present across most organ systems.
        2. At 72 hours, people are highly irritable and cannot stay awake. Hallucinations and paranoia are more common.
        3. Mental state declines steadily past this point, and after 6 nights of sleep deprivation, sleep deprivation psychosis can happen.
  3. All-nighters are common, especially among working professionals and college students.
     1.  A study by A.M. Williamson and Anne-Marie Feyer \(2000\) states that:
     2.  short term sleep deprivation–17-19 hours awake
        1.  results in cognitive declines, measured by a 50% slower response rate
        2. comparable to alcohol intoxication of a BAC .1%. \[Transition: Now let’s review what we went over today in our discussion of sleep.\]
