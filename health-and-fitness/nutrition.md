# Nutrition

I enjoy reading about nutrition articles on  [examine.com](https://examine.com),  analyses of quality on [labdoor.com](http://labdoor.com), a variety of recipe websites. 

Macros I focus on:

* Protein - lean meat, beans, protein powder/bars
* Medium carbs - I like fruit, rice, and the occasional bagel so Keto isn't for me but I have read about the benefits
* Healthy fats
* Eating a lot of vegetables for fiber, taste, and vitamins!
*

Supplements I currently take on a scattered basis:

* Creatine
* Protein powder - MyProtein
* Magnesium
* Vitamin D
* Zinc
* Melatonin
* Bacopa Moneirri 

When I have more willpower, might try intermittent fasting. Right now, I enjoy eating a lot and I try not to obsess over things too much.
