# Nutrition

I enjoy reading about nutrition articles on  [examine.com](https://examine.com),  analyses of quality on [labdoor.com](http://labdoor.com), and a variety of recipe websites. 

### Macros/Types I focus on:

First, analyze the Glycemic Index of foods per [http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/12/2281](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/12/2281), cited by Harvard Medical School.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/tablea1\_1.pdf" caption="Table A1. Glycemic index \(GI\) and glycemic load \(GL\) values determined in subjects with normal glucose tolerance: 2008" %}

* **Protein** - lean meat, beans, protein powder/bars. Provides steady release of glucose throughout the day.
* **Low-ish carbs** - Aiming to transition away from processed food and grains. 
* Healthy fats
* Eating a lot of vegetables for fiber, taste, and vitamins!
* Fruit is good and excess fructose can be burned off with exercise.
*

### Supplements 

I currently take these  on a scattered basis:

* Creatine
* Protein powder - MyProtein
* Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin D, Zinc complex
* Melatonin
* Bacopa Moneirri 
* Caffeine â†’  coffee (& tea). 
  * For coffee, I use the Aeropress, French Press, a drip coffee maker, and reusable K-Cups/ Keurig regularly lol. 
    * https://prima-coffee.com
    * https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/ 
    * [Sweet Maria's](http://www.sweetmarias.com/index.php) 
    * [JIMSEVEN](http://www.jimseven.com/) 

When I have more willpower, might try intermittent fasting. Right now, I enjoy eating a lot and I try not to obsess over things too much. 

&lt;hr&gt;

Definitely recommend watching this [documentary](https://theperfecthumandiet2.com) which motivated me to look more into the topic. The following are a few take aways:

* For optimal health, it makes sense to base a diet on millions of years of evolution, as the research stands up much better than a 6 mo to years cohort studies.
* In the last 30,000 years, our nutrition has decreased with the advent of agriculture and introduction of grains and processed plant materials into our diet.
