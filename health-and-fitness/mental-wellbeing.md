# Mental Wellbeing

## Physical / Integrated Approach

‌Your brain is an entirely physical organ, so every emotion and thought really _is_ just a pattern of electrochemical impulses. **This is the primary reason exercise, sleep, and nutrition are so important.**

‌It's easy to think of the mind as so disconnected from the body, but it's a part of it. You cannot separate the two when you are still a functioning biological organism. Though you cannot control events/situations all the time, you have a high degree of control of how you react and process things. 

‌Exercise is amazing because it increases blood flow to your brain and generally essential for good health. Also, those sweet endorphins.‌

Sleep regulates hormones responsible for appetite/satiety, mood regulation, and learning & much more. Your body cannot run optimally without proper sleep. It's odd how being sleep deprived is like a badge of honor in the 24/7 culture of America. I find being efficient and working smart is way more easily doable when you are properly rested.

Nutrition matters because you are literally what you eat, in a way. Metabolism breaks down what you eat and converts it into building blocks to synthesize, heal, and repair. Without adequate nutrition, your body will not perform its best, and likewise, your brain.

## Thought Remodeling 

**Focus on Now**

For me, it's easy to get lost and think about the future and then try to over analyze and over label everything. It's okay to be unsure and it's healthy to live in the present. Having goals is great, but not when they overshadow your ability to enjoy the current moment/reality _right_ now. 

**Don't Be Neurotic** 

Definitely easier said than done, considering I am still mildly neurotic in a lot of ways. I've gotten a lot better, mostly because I try to keep things in perspective and I also try to focus on what really matters to me. [Running](fitness.md#running) helps with this. 

Another form of neuroticism is trying to label myself. Identity shifts and you don't need to find a defining label for yourself or feel pressure to share how you define yourself to others. For me, I think it is okay to be ambiguous/wishwashy in terms of your personal sense of self because it tends to evolve over time. Not saying you should be wishwashy with how you treat others, though lol. 

**Be more at peace with yourself and your own journey**

Not fighting emotions helps me, as well as trying to center myself and stay in my own lane. Comparing yourself to others in terms of your own struggles, challenges, pacing at whatever goal, etc. is not a productive or healthy use of your time.

**Mood Tracking**

When my mood feel wild AF,  I like to track it with an app called MoodNotes but you can use anything, like the notes section in your phone. Tracking your mood and what causes shifts can help you recenter your thoughts and analyze their path. I don't do it when I'm feeling chill, but it really helped when I was out of commission from running and feeling restless and annoying all the time. 

**Look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**

If you are need of therapy, see a healthcare professional. It's not embarassing or something to be ashamed of. I personally have not been to therapy, but the Moodnotes app I use occasionally  has a few features that are based upon the CBT model. 

CBT is an approach to remodel your thoughts. 

> Cognitive behavioral therapy \(CBT\) is a common type of talk therapy \(psychotherapy\). You work with a mental health counselor \(psychotherapist or therapist\) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

> CBT can be a very helpful tool ― either alone or in combination with other therapies ― in treating mental health disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) or an eating disorder. But not everyone who benefits from CBT has a mental health condition. CBT can be an effective tool to help anyone learn how to better manage stressful life situations.-
