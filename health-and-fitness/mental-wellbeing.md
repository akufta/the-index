# Mental Wellbeing

## Physical / Integrated Approach

Your brain is a wholly physical organ, so every emotion and thought really _is_ just a pattern of electrochemical impulses. **This is the primary reason exercise, sleep, and nutrition are so important.**

It's easy to think of the mind as so disconnected from the body, but it's a part of it. You cannot separate the two when you are still a functioning biological organism.

Exercise is amazing because it increases blood flow to your brain and generally essentail for good health. Also, those sweet endorphins!

Sleep regulates hormones responsible for appetite/satiety, mood regulation, and learning & much more. 

Nutrition matters because you are literally what you eat, in a way. Metabolism breaks down what you eat and converts it into building blocks to synthesize, heal, and repair. Without adequate nutrition, your body will not perform its best, and likewise, your brain. 

## Thought Remodeling 

**Focus on Now**

For me, it's easy to get lost and think about the future and then try to over analyze and over label everything. It's okay to be unsure and it's healthy to live in the present. Having goals is great, but not when they overshadow your ability to enjoy the current moment/reality _right_ now. 

**Don't Be Neurotic** 

Definitely easier said than done, considering I am still mildly neurotic in a lot of ways. I've gotten a lot better, mostly because I try to keep things in perspective and I also try to focus on what really matters to me. [Running](fitness.md#running) helps with this. 

Another form of neuroticism is trying to label myself. Identity shifts and you don't need to find a defining label for yourself or feel pressure to share what you think of yourself as with everyone. It's okay to be ambigious/wishwashy in terms of your personal sense of self. Not saying you should be wishwashy with others lol. 

**Mood Tracking**

When I notice myself spiralling or heading towards the deep end of stress or whatever, I like to track it with an app called MoodNotes but you can use anything, like the notes section in your phone. Tracking your mood and what causes shifts can help you recenter your thoughts and analyze their path. 

I don't really use it during breaks or when I am feeling that normal because I try to live in the moment if things are gucci. 

**Look into CBT**

The app, MoodNotes, helped you do this yourself, but CBT is an approach to remodel your thoughts. 

> Cognitive behavioral therapy \(CBT\) is a common type of talk therapy \(psychotherapy\). You work with a mental health counselor \(psychotherapist or therapist\) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

> CBT can be a very helpful tool ― either alone or in combination with other therapies ― in treating mental health disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) or an eating disorder. But not everyone who benefits from CBT has a mental health condition. CBT can be an effective tool to help anyone learn how to better manage stressful life situations.-
