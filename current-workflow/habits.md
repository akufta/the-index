# Habits

There are a few interesting books on this topic I definitely want to read. 

One definitely is The Power of Habit. 

I am pretty relaxed in terms of routines. I usually am for frequency not always 100% consistency because if I skip a day, then I feel guilty and have a hard time getting back to it.

One except is meditation, which I try to do every single day. During the school year, I meditated 20 minutes in the morning right after I ate, which is right after I woke up. Helps me get over the feeling that just woke up surge of anger. 

In the summer, it's actually a bit harder to stay focused for some reason.
