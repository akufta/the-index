# Habits

### Current Habits in 2019

* Pushups +1 
  * Had to take a break bc of my shoulder, but this is an awesome way that James Clear talks about to establish & build this great habit.
* Meditate & Reflect
  * More on this in the subsequent area of this. 
  * I used to try to journal + think about my mood/emotions each night after I meditate with current thoughts, events, and goals for the next day.
  * It started feeling like a chore to formally meditate and track it, so I now just try to be more mindful in general. I might return to meditiation soon, once I am in the right frame of mind.  
* Vitamin D / Melatonin / Magnesium 
  * I am experimenting with supplements that I researched on a few sites, mainly [https://examine.com](https://examine.com) and [http://gwern.net](http://gwern.net). 
* Read 20 pages a day 
  * This is very doable and I do it in the morning and sometimes finish off at night. 
  * I love to read and gain new perspective, knowledge, and insight. Sometimes it can just be straight up emotional or entertaining, which is great too.

### May aim to implement

I am trying to make sure daily routines don't become overly structured and annoying but I might add write 20 minutes a day or something to the mix. 

### Notes

There are a few interesting books on this topic I definitely want to read.

One definitely is [The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg](https://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/).

I am pretty relaxed in terms of routines. I aim for every day but try not to be overly neurotic in achieving every single day. I find myself stuck if I skip a day, because I feel guilty and have a hard time getting back to it. I try not to skip more than once, but I also work to not be too hard on myseflf for being human.
