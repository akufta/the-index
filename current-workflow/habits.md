### Current Habits in 2020

* Workout in some way close to every day
  * I listen to my body more now that I've had a few more injuries. I run about every other day and then go on fast walks in between. I've also incorporated more regular body weight routines, usually a quick 10 min workout to supplement. They add up though and I notice I have much better core strength as a result. I took a long haitus from that kind of workout since HS, but it's good to be back. 
* Meditate & Reflect
  * I used to do this in 2019 more consistently, but things were a whirlwind early 2020 so I stopped. I probably will get back to it. Right now, I feel like I live in the moment pretty well and am mindful without formalized mindfulness activities. I do hope to get back into it though, because I did like the structure. 
  * Will try to journal + think about my mood/emotions each night and also go over thoughts, events, as well as goals for the next day. 
  *  Will try to return to gentle meditation.
* Vitamin D / Melatonin / Magnesium 
  * I am experimenting with supplements that I researched on a few sites, mainly [https://examine.com](https://examine.com) and [http://gwern.net](http://gwern.net). 
  * I like eating vitamins so I still do this
* Read 20 pages a day

  * Also fell off of this in the same way as meditation/reflection. I've gotten back into the swing of things a bit, but not as much as I'd like. 
  * This is very doable.
  * I think I might do this right after making coffee/breakfast instead of staring at my phone. 

### Current Habits in 2019

* Pushups +1 
  * I started this in late December but then reset the rep numbers at the 1st to make it easier to keep up with.  I will aim to increase to like 30.  â†’ I had to stop because my shoulder popped bc I didn't do rows. Probably should get pull up bar or just use bands to alternate. 
* Meditate & Reflect
  * More on this in the subsequent area of this. 
  * I try to journal + think about my mood/emotions each night after I meditate with current thoughts, events, and goals for the next day. 
* Vitamin D / Melatonin / Magnesium 
  * I am experimenting with supplements that I researched on a few sites, mainly [https://examine.com](https://examine.com) and [http://gwern.net](http://gwern.net). 
* Read 20 pages a day
  * This is very doable and I do it in the morning and sometimes finish off at night. 

### May aim to implement

I am trying to make sure daily routines don't become overly structured and annoying but I might add write 20 minutes a day or something to the mix. 

### Notes

There are a few interesting books on this topic I definitely want to read.

One definitely is [The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg](https://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/).

I am pretty relaxed in terms of routines. I aim for every day but try not to be overly neurotic in achieving every single day. I find myself stuck if I skip a day, because I feel guilty and have a hard time getting back to it. Though there is a nice rule with don't miss every day. 

One except is meditation, which ~~I tr~~y used to do every single day. During the school year, I meditated 20 minutes in the morning right after I ate, which is right after I woke up.  

In the summer, it's actually a bit harder to stay focused for some reason.

Right now, I am getting back into it and try to meditate at night for increasing amounts of time. Trying not to view it as a chore, because it's not.
