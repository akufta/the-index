      **It’s okay to buck conventional wisdom if something else works better for you.** Find you get more done when you don’t wake up at 5:30 every morning? Then sleep in! Find you get more done when you don’t do your most important task first thing in the morning, and instead answer a bunch of emails? Then answer your email!

      There is usually a kernel of truth behind every piece of productivity advice and conventional wisdom, but there are also a ton of productivity techniques that simply won’t work for you. Everyone thinks differently and has different priorities, so no piece of productivity advice will work perfectly for 100% of people, 100% of the time.

      It’s okay to buck conventional wisdom if something else works better for you—and you should.

      **7. Forming good habits makes you more productive automatically**

      **I think one of the best ways to become more productive is to convert new, productive behaviors into habits so you do them automatically.**

      According to Charles Duhigg, the author of [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400069289/?tag=ayeaofpro-20), 40–45% of our daily activities are automatic habits. Habit formation isn’t easy, and it sometimes takes a few months to integrate a new habit into your life, but once a new behavior becomes a habit, you automatically level up to become more productive.

      For example, it took me a few months to form a habit to [wake up at 5:30 every morning](https://alifeofproductivity.com/waking-up-early-solidify-morning-wakeup-ritual/), but after I did, waking up early became a [keystone habit](https://alifeofproductivity.com/3-ways-identify-keystone-habits-habits-set-chain-reaction-change-everything/) and I woke up early every morning automatically. It also took me several weeks to integrate a [new eating regimen](https://alifeofproductivity.com/body-composition-experiment-introduction/) into my life, but after I did, my new eating habits simply became part of the tapestry of my life; blending in with all of my other automatic behaviors.

      If you want to learn how to integrate new habits into your life, check out [my interview with Charles](https://alifeofproductivity.com/resolutions/chapter5/). Forming new habits isn’t easy, especially when you have to expend willpower to will yourself into changing your behavior at first, but things get progressively easier as you go on, until you finally become more productive automatically.

    * **6. There are three ingredients you combine on a daily basis to be productive: time, energy, and attention**

      Toward the end of my project, I realized that every single article I wrote could be classified into one \(or more\) of three categories: how to better manage your **time**, how to better manage your **energy**, and how to better manage your **attention**.

      **I think all three ingredients are absolutely essential if you want to be productive on a daily basis.** 

      **Interlude: 10 productivity experiments from my year of productivity**

      10 of my favorite experiments from my year of productivity, in no particular order. 

      If there is a secret to becoming more productive, I didn’t find it during my year of experimenting with and exploring productivity.

      But what I did discover were hundreds of tactics that I could use to better manage my time, energy, and attention. In fact, **I uncovered so many of these tactics that I assembled** [**a list of my favorite 100**](https://alifeofproductivity.com/100-time-energy-attention-hacks-will-make-productive) **tactics when I closed out my year.**

      Productivity is very much a holistic concept, characterized by the understanding of its interconnected parts. There are hundreds \(if not thousands\) of factors that contribute to how much you get done every day, every single one of which has to do with being able to manage your time, energy, and attention.

      There isn’t one secret to becoming more productive—there are [hundreds](https://alifeofproductivity.com/100-time-energy-attention-hacks-will-make-productive).

      **4. Working too hard or too much shatters your productivity**

      Over the course of my project, I found that working too hard or too much completely shattered my productivity.

      As a [productivity experiment](https://alifeofproductivity.com/experiments/) I worked 90-hour weeks for a month, alternating between working 90 hours one week and then 20 hours the next. I actually found that I got about as much work done in both my 90-hour and 20-hour weeks, for a simple reason: **when I limited how much time I spent on a task, I forced myself to exert more energy over less time so I could get the task done in what limited time I had**. When I threw more time at my work in my longer weeks, I tended to procrastinate more, work on lower-leverage activities, and waste more time.

      What happens when you work too hard and throw too much energy at a task? You burn out. \(Interestingly, I didn’t uncover any adverse effects to throwing more attention at a task, though I find that your attention and energy levels often rise and fall in tandem.\) I think of energy as the fuel a person burns throughout the day to get work done. **When you throw more energy at your work without taking the time to recharge or nurture your energy levels along the way—like by** [**exercising**](https://alifeofproductivity.com/exercise-to-boost-your-focus/)**,** [**taking breaks**](https://alifeofproductivity.com/get-work-done-take-breaks/)**,** [**eating well**](https://alifeofproductivity.com/body-composition-experiment-introduction/)**, or investing in** [**effective stress relief strategies**](https://alifeofproductivity.com/9-stress-relief-strategies-that-actually-work/)**—you’re going to run out of fuel and burn out.**

      Working too much or too hard completely shatters your productivity because doing so robs you of two of your most valuable resources: your time, and your energy.



      **3. The best way to feel motivated is to know why you want to get something done**

      **2. Becoming more productive is pointless if you’re not kind to yourself in the process**

      **The reason I write so much about being kind to yourself on A Year of Productivity is because it’s the part of productivity that I struggle with the most.**

      Constantly be mindful of how kind you are to yourself when you’re pushing yourself to get more done. When [80% of what you say to yourself in your head is already negative](https://alifeofproductivity.com/resolutions/chapter7/), it’s important that you are kind to yourself every chance you get, particularly when you’re putting more pressure on yourself to become a better human being.A few tactics that helped me be kind to myself over my year of productivity: [meditating](https://alifeofproductivity.com/meditation-guide/), [taking more breaks](https://alifeofproductivity.com/get-work-done-take-breaks/), [completely disconnecting from my work](https://alifeofproductivity.com/productivity-experiment-take-three-hour-afternoon-siesta/) a few times a day, and [adopting habits that lead to more happiness](https://alifeofproductivity.com/5-habits-lead-happiness/).

      **1. Productivity isn’t about how much you produce, it’s about how much you accomplish**

      When I first started my year of productivity, I created a [Stats](https://alifeofproductivity.com/statistics/) page so I could share exactly how productive I was every day. Every day I posted the number of words I wrote, pages I read, and hours I worked, because I considered these to be pretty good measurements of how productive I was.

      I couldn’t have been more wrong.

      **Unless you run a factory, measuring your productivity based only on how much you produce gives you only a shallow, limited picture of how productive you are.** In fact, if you come up with an intelligent and creative approach to a problem—let’s say that you find a way to write 500 words in 100—when you measure your productivity simply by how much you produce, you’re much less productive!

      It’s easy to get caught up on measurements and statistics, but as far as personal productivity is concerned, statistics are secondary. Productivity isn’t about how much you produce, it’s about how much you accomplish.

      It’s important to do tasks that are high leverage and meaningful, and it’s also important that you know how to manage your time, energy, and attention so you have the resources you need to get more done. But at the end of the day, when you have no more time, energy, or attention left, the only thing you’re left with is what you have accomplished, and the difference you have made in the world because you did something valuable with a day of your life.

      That’s what productivity is all about.
