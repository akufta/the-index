  This keeps evolvi as time goes on as I find new ways to optimize without
  getting overly addicted to the tools. In some ways, I've found simpler
  alternatives. It's easy to get caught up in the details.

# Current Workflow

## Life 

* [Habits](habits.md) - I try to include a few loose habits into my life without going crazy and over structuring my day. Then I tend to get nervous and lose sight of goals and being happy and balanced. 
  * I currently do not actively track most of my habits. When implementing a habit, I do track it though! I used to practice meditation, but I am taking time off because it felt like a chore to me, and I know it isn't. I tracked that habit, though. 
* [Health](../health-and-fitness/) - I am very into fitness, nutrition, and exercise. Taking care of health is a strong priority for me. Not only does it feel better, but it also helps you impact the earth in a better way as well as lessen financial risk that comes with preventable health problems like obesity & the comorbidities that come with that. However, I do think allowing yourself to rest & enjoy an unhealthy treat once in a while is worth it.
  * I use my ~~fitbit~~ Garmin watch to track my health. 
  * When you are into running, tracking your recovery from injuries/surgeries is helpful so you don't over do it. It also helps you find out what your body responds best to, in terms of ice/therapeautic exercise, etc. 

### Journal 

I used to do this more regularly and plan to reimplement it into my routine in the mornings. I sporadically journal, and when I do, I use [moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com) because I like knowing how my mood changes over time. 

## Tasks

[Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/)  → [TickTick](http://ticktick.com) is what I use right now, and I really like it. I have categories for media consumption, projects, university, and personal learning goals. It's helpful and using one app helps me to minimize and keep from accumulating too many tools. 

* I also don't really use that many folders/tags. I set them up, but actually more like to use the next 7 days feature for time sensitive tasks for school. For long term things, folders are what I like to use. 

I also use [fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) as my calendar app because it has a lot of useful features that are worth paying for, at least for me. Calendars are helpful.

## General Note Taking

This still stumps me because I am still searching for the tools I want to use, which isn't really that good because I over research.

### Gathering information

Right now, I basically gather resources into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)/[Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) \(kept in sync with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover)\),  visual things to [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/), and research items into [Zotero](http://zotero.org).  I also use my bookmarks bar for frequently visited sites. 

Kozmos.cool is an alternative to pocket that I might switch to. It's in private beta and it's pretty cool. 

### Consolidating information

If I can organize my thoughts into something cohesive, I will post about it on my site. If not, I try to take snippets of favorite articles and archive them. 

Right now, I am using [archivebox](https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox), which is a great tool to create a self-hosted and searchable web archive. 

This whole thing is still a work in progress, honestly. 

## Writing and Coding

I love writing both creative and nonfiction material. For creative work, I am using [**Scrivener**](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) and [**Typora** ](https://typora.io/). Typora is wonderful for markdown articles and Scrivener is awesome for organizing longer projects. 

For coding: I use the lovely [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It’s fast, flexible, and I use it every day to modify this website’s code. I primarily make CSS and HTML changes, and customize the templates. I also like Atom for other features and plug ins, so it's fun to switch between the two. 

I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) as my terminal instead of the default.
