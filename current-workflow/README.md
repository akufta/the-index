# Current Workflow

This has evolved as time goes on as I find new ways to optimize without getting overly addicted to the tools. In some ways, I've found simpler alternatives. It's easy to get caught up in the details. 

A more detailed version of this post can be found [here](https://kalispera.xyz/post/a-curated-collection-of-favorite-productivity-and-organization-programs/#my-current-favorite-productivity-tools-and-set-up). 

## Life 

* [Habits](habits.md) - I try to include a few loose habits into my life without going crazy and over structuring my day. Then I tend to get nervous and lose sight of goals and being happy and balanced. 
  * I currently do not actively track most of my habits, bar meditation. When implementing a habit, I do track it though!
* [Health](../health-and-fitness/) - very into fitness and exerice. Taking care of health is a strong priority for me. Not only does it feel better, but it also helps you impact the earth in a better way as well as lessen financial risk that comes with preventable health problems like obesity & the comorbidities that come with that. 
  * I use my fitbit to track my health. I plan to get a Garmin watch once I can run again. Also, I document my recovery from sx because it is helpful and also keeps me less paranoid. 

### Journal 

I used to do this more regularly and plan to reimplement it into my routine after morning meditation. I sporadically journal, and when I do, I use [moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com) because I like knowing how my mood changes over time. 

## Tasks

[Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) is what I use right now, and I really like it. I have categories for media consumption, projects, university, and personal learning goals. It's helpful and using one app helps me to minimize and keep from accumulating too many tools. 

I also use [fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) as my calendar app because it has a lot of useful features that are worth paying for, at least for me. Calendars are helpful.

## General Note Taking

This still stumps me because I am still searching for the tools I want to use, which isn't really that good because I over research.

### Gathering information

Right now, I basically gather resources into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)/[Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) \(kept in sync with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover)\),  visual things to [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/), and research items into [Zotero](http://zotero.org).  I also use my bookmarks bar for frequently visited sites. 

Kozmos.cool is an alternative to pocket that I might switch to. It's in private beta and it's pretty cool. 

### Consolidating information

If I can organize my thoughts into something cohesive, I will post about it on my site. If not, I try to take snippets of favorite articles and archive them. 

Right now, I am using [archivebox](https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox), which is a great tool to create a self-hosted and searchable web archive. 

This whole thing is still a work in progress, honestly. 

## Writing and Coding

I love writing both creative and nonfiction material. For creative work, I am using [**Scrivener**](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) and [**Typora** ](https://typora.io/). Typora is wonderful for markdown articles and Scrivener is awesome for organizing longer projects. 

For coding: I use the lovely [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It’s fast, flexible, and I use it every day to modify this website’s code. I primarily make CSS and HTML changes, and customize the templates. I also like Atom for other features and plug ins, so it's fun to switch between the two. 

I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) as my terminal instead of the default.
